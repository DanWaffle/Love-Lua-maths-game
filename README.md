# Love-Lua-maths-game

Simple lua maths game madde with the love2d framework, along with other community-made libraries.

##How to run
To run you can download the exe in the releases or you can build it yourself by going here: https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/  and dowloading Love 0.10.2, then use the command:
```
"path-to-love/love.exe" "path-to-gamefolder"
```
Remember that the second factor in the command above is the path to the game folder, <b>Not</b> to the executable.
